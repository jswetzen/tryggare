def should_start_scheduler() -> bool:
    """Decide whether this process should start the in-app job scheduler.

    Unlike ``demo``'s scheduler (opt-in via ``DEMO_MODE``), the GDPR retention
    sweep needs to run by default in every real deployment — that's the whole
    point, so self-hosters don't have to wire external cron themselves. So we
    can't gate on an opt-in env var; we need to distinguish "this process is
    the long-running server" from "this process is a one-off management
    command" (``test``, ``migrate``, ``makemigrations``, ``shell``, seed
    commands, etc.) — ``AppConfig.ready()`` runs for both.

    Every one-off invocation goes through ``manage.py`` (``sys.argv[0]`` is
    ``manage.py``). The real server, in both dev (``docker-compose.yml``) and
    prod (``Dockerfile.prod`` / ``docker-compose.prod.yml`` /
    ``docker-compose.portainer.yml``), is launched directly as
    ``python -m daphne ...`` — never via ``manage.py runserver`` — so its
    ``sys.argv[0]`` is daphne's entry point, not ``manage.py``. Gating on that
    reliably tells "serving" apart from "tooling" without an extra env var.

    This is exclusion-based (anything not ``manage.py`` starts it), so a
    future gunicorn/celery worker process would each start their own
    duplicate scheduler. Benign today — the 3 AM window, ``anonymized_at``
    idempotency, and the atomic transaction in the retention command mean
    duplicate runs are harmless — but worth tightening to an allowlist
    (e.g. explicitly checking for daphne) if a second process type is added.
